# Hacking on the photon from [particle](https://particle.io)

I'm using [this guide](https://docs.particle.io/reference/javascript/) to get started, so far it's pretty easy to follow along.
For any of this to work you'll need to login to the [particle dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.io) and add your device.  

You'll need to add env variables for your particle account username and password, of course. Supply these in .env:

    PARTICLE_USERNAME=email@address.com  
    PARTICLE_PASSWORD=password  

then run npm start
